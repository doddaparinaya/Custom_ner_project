As long as my son likes it.
These shoes are great! They are light and comfy, I wear these almost every day
The shoes are durable, comfortable, breathable, natural-gate, runners that work great in general workouts as well. I’ll get them for as long as they are sold.
Although the size 10 size was appropriate lengthwise, the width of the shoe was too small & caused pain after wearing it for a short while for my 16 yr old son.
perfect as always!!!Nothing feels like Nike!!!
Dang. I bought another 4 pairs of these. Comfort heaven straight out of the box. The only issue is that the shoe strings cannot stay tied for anything - even in double knots...it's very odd - and this is the case on all the pairs. Other than that, wow.
I hope Nike never stops making these shoes. There are a couple of minor negatives. The soles are prone to pick up pebbles and the sole wears quickly. Even so, the 5-star rating is well deserved. The shoes are the barefoot feel type. I'm starting my third consecutive pair since 2013. As long as these shoes are available, I'll never wear anything else.
I set a goal of 350 miles on my Nike app for these shoes but I suspect I'll get many more than that before they are ready for sneaker heaven. I'm just starting to get into serious runs (a few weeks shy of my 49th birthday) and found these recommended on a website. They certainly are lightweight and fit very well. My first run took me 6.6 miles which is the most I've done to this point so right now they have been more than worth it. Nike doesn't disappoint and the free run only adds to their vast legend.
Bought these and they are comfortable, form fitting and they don’t move around. Keeps your foot snug and like the other 1,000,000 reviews, the verdict is buy, buy, buy again. You deserve these shoes. Don’t miss out on this opportunity.
They are very confee bruh
